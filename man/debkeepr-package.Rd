\title{debkeepr: Analysis of Non-Decimal Currencies and Double-Entry Bookkeeping}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Analysis of historical non-decimal currencies and value systems that use tripartite or tetrapartite systems such as pounds, shillings, and pence. It introduces new vector classes to represent non-decimal currencies, making them compatible with numeric classes, and provides functions to work with these classes in data frames in the context of double-entry bookkeeping.
