Description: Analysis of historical non-decimal currencies and value
    systems that use tripartite or tetrapartite systems such as pounds,
    shillings, and pence. It introduces new vector classes to represent
    non-decimal currencies, making them compatible with numeric classes,
    and provides functions to work with these classes in data frames in
    the context of double-entry bookkeeping.
